## Eva Balog
A self-motivated and enthusiastic member of the
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) and
[Codebar](https://codebar.io/) alumni network with strong communication and organisation skills and over ten years of experience in Customer Service, Training & Development and Recruitment gained through various managerial and support roles. Strong advocate of sustainability, transparency and lifelong learning. Passionate about technology and its potential for the service of society.  
From an operational role within the social model of disability, I've started learning programming in January 2017 as a response to the deficiency of technological tools in the third sector. During my time at Makers I mostly enjoyed third party API integrations, designing databases (using PostgreSQL) and playing with naive bayes classifiers to improve accuracy for sentiment analysis. I'm currently looking for a role as a software developer and feeling excited about deepening my knowledge and empowering people with my freshly gained skills.

## Skills

#### Creative problem-solver
Strong problem solving skills developed through hands-on experience in operations and life in general.  
I needed three shoe racks, but there was only two left in stock. Therefore I've bought and re-designed those two and created a less 'off-the-shelf' solution that met all my needs:

#### Implementation skills
As a Unit Manager for PAUL UK Ltd, I had to implement many new procedures as the business was expanding and company policies became more defined.  

#### Empowering others
Ability to develop/motivate others by identifying training gaps and establishing SMART objectives.

#### Prioritization
I'm able to prioritize workload effectively to meet tight deadlines under pressure. After graduating at Makers, I've realised that I've made quite a few mistakes in terms of getting myself ready to apply for jobs, including, but not limited to, not updating my CV to reflect skills and capabilities that would demonstrate my competence to be a junior software developer, not writing READMEs for my projects. Therefore I've written a list of priorities that I can follow to get back on track:  
- [x] Write a to-do list in order of priority (check!)  
- [x] Check grammar and spelling before committing to GitHub (WIP)
- [x] Update CV to demonstrate skills relevant to the jobs I want to apply for  
- [ ] Provide evidence for the skills highlighted in CV   
- [ ] Link most exciting projects to CV (even if they are unfinished)  
- [ ] Finish READMEs for all of my projects   
- [ ] Finish projects that are linked to CV or at least make them presentable   


#### Commercial awareness
Being responsible for P&L, I had a good understanding of the wider environment in which our business operated and successfully managed variable costs, also exceeded sales targets by 15% in the first year when taking over management of my first shop at Holland Park.

#### Autonomous
Ability to use own initiative by working competently without close supervision.
