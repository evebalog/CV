## Eva Balog
A self-motivated and enthusiastic member of the
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) and
[Codebar](https://codebar.io/) alumni network with strong communication and organisation skills and over ten years of experience in Customer Service, Training & Development and Recruitment gained through various managerial and support roles.

From an operational role within the social model of disability, I've started learning programming in January 2017 as a response to the deficiency of technological tools in the third sector. I'm currently looking for a role as a software developer and feeling excited about deepening my knowledge and empowering people with my freshly gained skills.
